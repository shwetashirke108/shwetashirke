<p>Kolhapur is one of the most significant cities in South Maharashtra and has been a hub of historical, religious, and cultural activities for centuries. It is famous for its unique food culture, including its signature Kolhapuri cuisine. The city is situated in the western part of Maharashtra and is often referred to as "Dakshin Kashi" or "Mahateerth". It boasts a rich history,
    which has given it various other names, including Kollagiri, Kolladigiripattan and Kollpur, all meaning "valley" [citation needed] Around 2 CE 
    Kolhapur's name was 'Kuntal'.Kolhapur is known as 'Dakshin Kashi' or Kashi of the South because of its spiritual history and the antiquity of its

    Kolhapuri chappal, which received the Geographical Indication designation in 2019. In Hindu mythology, the city is referred to as "Karvir.
    Kolhapur is named after Kolhasur, a demon in Hindu History.[9] According to legend, the demon Kolhasur renounced asceticism after his 
    sons were killed by the gods for harassing people. He prayed to Mahalakshmi, requesting that she leave the area to him for a hundred years.
    He committed numerous crimes during this period until the goddess returned after the hundred years were over and killed him for his sins.
    Kolhasur's dying wish was to name the place after him, a request granted, and the area was named Kolhapur. 'Kolha' represents Kolhasur, 
    and 'pur,' a Sanskrit word, means 'city.</p>

    <h1>**Mumbai**</h1>

<p>Mumbai, officially the capital of Maharashtra, India, is a vibrant and bustling metropolis located on the
    Konkan coast. It's known as India's "Economic Capital" and "Financial Hub," attracting a diverse population 
    and serving as a major center for industry, culture, and entertainment. Mumbai's history is rich, evolving
    from a group of seven islands to the sprawling city it is today. The seven islands that constitute Mumbai were
    earlier home to communities of Marathi language-speaking Koli people.For centuries, the sevenislands of Bombay
    were under the control of successive indigenous rulers before being ceded to the Portuguese Empire, and 
    subsequently to the East India Company in 1661, as part of the dowry of Catherine of Braganza in her marriage 
    to Charles II of England.Beginning in 1782, Mumbai was reshaped by the Hornby Vellard project,which undertook reclamation of the area between the seven islands 
    from the Arabian Sea.Along with the construction of major roads and railways, the reclamation
    project, completed in 1845, transformed Mumbai into a major seaport on the Arabian Sea. Mumbai in
    the 19th century was characterised by economic and educational development. During the early 20th 
    century it became a strong base for the Indian independence movement. Upon India's independence in 
    1947 the city was incorporated into Bombay State. In 1960, following the Samyukta Maharashtra Movement,
    a new state of Maharashtra was created with Mumbai as the capital.

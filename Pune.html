<p>Pune was part of the Jagir (fiefdom) granted by the Nizamshahi (Ahmadnagar Sultanate) to Maloji Bhosale in 1599.
    [33] Maloji Bhosale passed on Jagir of Pune to his son Shahaji Bhosale. The town was destroyed by Murar Jagdeo,
    a general from the rival Adil Shahi dynasty in 1636. Shahaji himself soon joined Adilshahi and regained the 
    Pune jagir. At that time he selected the town for the residence of his wife Jijabai, and young son Shivaji, 
    the future founder of the Maratha empire. Shahaji appointed Dadoji Konddeo to help Jijabai in the 
    administration of Jagir and in the reconstruction of the town. The Lal Mahal residence of Jiajabai and
    Shivaji was completed in 1640 AD.[28] Shivaji spent his young years at the Lal Mahal. Jijabai is said to
     have commissioned the building of the Kasba Ganapati temple. The Ganesha idol consecrated at this temple
    has been regarded as the presiding deity (Gramadevata) of the city.[34] Pune changed hands between the
    Mughals and the Marathas many times during the rest of the 1600s. Recognizing the military potential of
    Pune, the Mughal general Shaista Khan and later, the emperor Aurangzeb further developed the areas
    around the town.Pune was occupied again by Marathas in June 1670, four months to the battle of 
    Sinhagad and remained in the hands of Marathas. From 1703 to 1705, towards the end of the 27-year-long 
    Mughalâ€“Maratha Wars, the town was occupied by Mughal emperor Aurangzeb and its name was changed 
    temporarily to Muhiyabad.This name was abandoned and reverted to its original name soon after
    Aurangzeb's death.

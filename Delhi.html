   <h1>**Delhi**</h1>
<img src="delhi.jpg"height="400"width="400">  
<p>Traditionally seven cities have been associated with the region of Delhi. The earliest, Indraprastha, is part of a literary description in the Sanskrit epic Mahabharata (composed c. 400 BCE to 300 CE but describing an earlier time[40]) which situates a city on a knoll on the banks of the river Yamuna. According to art historian Catherine B. Asher, the topographical description of the Mahabharata matches the area of Purana Qila, a 14th-century CE fort of the Delhi sultanate, but the analogy does not go much further. Whereas the Mahabharata speaks of a beautifully decorated city with surrounding fortifications, the excavations have yielded "uneven findings of painted grey pottery characteristic of the eleventh century BCE; no signs of a built environment, much fewer fortifications, have been revealed."[39]
The earliest architectural relics date back to the Maurya period (c. 300 BCE); in 1966, an inscription of the 
Mauryan Emperor Ashoka (273â€“235 BCE) was discovered near Srinivaspuri. Remains of several major cities can be
found in Delhi. The first of these was in the southern part of present-day Delhi. Tomara Rajput King Anang Pal
built the Lal Kot and several temples in 1052 CE. The Chauhan Rajputs under Vigraharaja IV conquered Lal Kot in
the mid-12th century and renamed it Qila Rai Pithora.
